# Reddit Mirror

This is my pet project on ReactJS. I'm trying to build a mirror of reddit.com using the reddit API.

Here I test my skills in ReactJS, Redux, React Router, Webpack, and other cool stuff.

I'm also trying to use the best practices in ReactJS development and the newest features of the used libraries and tools.

## Where to see it

You can see the project on aws ec2 instance: [Mirror of Reddit on React, RTK, React-Router with SSR](http://ec2-3-126-240-154.eu-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com)

## How to run on your machine

1. Clone the repo (use main branch)
2. Run `npm ci` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run build` to build the project
4. Run `npm run start` to start the server
5. Open `http://localhost:3000` (by default) in your browser
